Commands in the CLI are structured in _groups_ and _subgroups_.

Group : Each group represents a service provided by Azure

Subgroups : subgroups divide commands for these services into logical groupings

For example, the [[storage]] group contains subgroups including **account**, [[Azure Blob Storage]], and [[Azure Storage Queues]].
