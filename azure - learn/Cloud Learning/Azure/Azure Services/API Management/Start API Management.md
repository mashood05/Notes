[[API Management Resources]]

Azure api management acts as an API gateway, allowing you to publish APIs internally, externally, and amongst partner developers to extend your operations

Divided in to 3 Portals 

[[Dev Portal]]
[[Admin Portal]]
[[API Gateway - Proxy]]


When we publish our APIs using API Management it packaged int Product

Product contains 1 or more apis and have **title description and terms of uses** 
Products can be Open or Protected. 

Products can be 

1. Protected: means a developer must subscribe before they can use the API
2. Open: can be used without a subscription.


API management behavior's are controlled through the use of Policies.
