**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

PaaS is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. It includes infrastructure (like servers, storage, and networking) but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems, and more.
