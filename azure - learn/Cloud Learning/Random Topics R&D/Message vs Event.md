Event:  
it is a simple change which which, information we publish and don't care who gets it.

Message:
we confirm that message has been processed and derived and received.

### Event

An event is a lightweight notification of a condition or a state change. The publisher of the event has no expectation about how the event is handled. The consumer of the event decides what to do with the notification. Events can be used to trigger automated workflows.

Azure provides services like Event Grid and Event Hub for handling events.

- [[Event Grid - Pushing Modal]]: Allows applications to subscribe to and handle events. You can think of it as a reactive programming model where actions can be taken in response to events.
- [[Event Hub - Pulling modal]]: Mainly used for telemetry and big data scenarios. It's designed to handle large streams of events such as user activity in a web application.

### Message

A message, on the other hand, is a raw piece of data produced by one component and consumed by another. Messages often require a response, and the sender may have an expectation that the receiver will handle the message in a certain way.

Azure provides services like Service Bus for handling messages.

- **[[Azure Service Bus]]**: A more comprehensive message broker that provides different patterns like queues and topics/subscriptions. Messages in Service Bus can be used for lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) functions, where some transformation occurs as part of the message processing.

### Summary

1. **Intended Use**: Events are typically used for notifications, while messages might be used for more complex processing or command patterns.
2. **Expectation**: Events usually don't expect a response, while messages might.
3. **Content**: Events usually contain minimal information, just enough to signal something occurred. Messages might contain richer information.
4. **Services in Azure**: Events are commonly handled by Event Grid or Event Hub, whereas messages might be handled by Service Bus or other messaging services.
